# Public-and-Governmental-Debt-Analysis

## Overview
The Public-and-Governmental-Debt-Analysis project is an Excel-based solution designed to track and visualize U.S. public debt over time. The dataset contains daily records across multiple years, covering key debt categories such as "Debt Held by the Public" and "Intragovernmental Holdings." The project analyzes the historical trends in U.S. debt, calculates yearly and monthly percentage changes, and forecasts future debt growth.

# Features
_Historical Data Tracking:_ The project includes daily records of U.S. public debt across various categories like "Debt Held by the Public" and "Intragovernmental Holdings."

_Cleaned and Processed Data_: Raw debt data has been processed and cleaned in Excel, ensuring accuracy and consistency for analysis and visualization.

_Debt Trend Analysis_: The project calculates yearly and monthly percentage changes in public debt, highlighting significant growth or reduction periods.

_Projected Growth_: Forecasting of future debt trends is done using historical data.

# Data Cleaning Process
_Data Import:_ The initial raw data was imported into Excel. The data contains various debt categories recorded on different dates. This raw data includes some missing values and inconsistencies that require cleaning.

_Handling Missing Data:_ Any missing values or anomalies (e.g., negative values or outliers) were identified and addressed. Depending on the data pattern, missing values were either interpolated or excluded from analysis to avoid skewing the results.

_Consistency Checks:_ The data was examined for consistency across different debt categories. Checks were performed to ensure that all categories followed the same timestamp format and that no duplicate rows were present.

_Data Transformation:_ The raw data was structured into a more usable format, with the debt categories and their corresponding timestamps organized into separate columns for easier analysis. This transformation helps in making the data more accessible for further analysis and visualization.

# Data Visualization Process
_Graphical Representation_: Using Excelâ€™s built-in charting tools, several key visualizations were created to depict debt trends over time:

_Line Charts:_ Line charts were created for each debt category to show the trends in U.S. debt over time.
_Percentage Change Visualizations:_ Line charts and bar charts were used to visualize the yearly and monthly percentage changes in public debt, helping to identify patterns in debt growth or reduction.
Conditional Formatting: To emphasize significant changes in the debt, conditional formatting was applied to certain cells in the dataset. This helps highlight key trends and periods of high or low growth.

_Dashboard Creation:_ A dashboard was designed in Excel to bring together all the key visualizations and data in one place for easy access and quick insights. This dashboard includes interactive features like drop-down menus to filter data by specific categories or timeframes.

# Data Analysis Process
Yearly and Monthly Percentage Change:

The yearly percentage change was calculated to analyze the growth or reduction in public debt from one year to the next. This helps in understanding long-term trends in debt accumulation.
Similarly, the monthly percentage change was computed to identify short-term fluctuations in public debt.
_Trend Analysis:_ By applying statistical formulas, trends were examined for debt growth in different periods, with insights into periods of rapid debt increase or stability.

_Projection of Debt Growth:_ Using historical data, projections were made for future debt growth. Simple linear regression techniques were applied to predict future trends, assuming that past growth patterns would continue.

# Analysis Summary: 
A final summary analysis was created in the "Final Outputs" sheet, where key insights were drawn from the data trends and projections. This summary provides a clear understanding of the historical behavior of U.S. debt and the expected future trends.

# How to Use
